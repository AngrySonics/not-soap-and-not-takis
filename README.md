tuff bootleg version of soap and takis by luigi budd (HE KNOWS ABOUT THIS HE HAS HOSTED WITH IT SEVERAL TIMES)

go build it yourself because i dont have a server to dump gitbuilds to unlike luigi budds soap yar thing

any reusable stuff in this mod is used because it is either reusable or was marked as reusable at the time
